            <h3>Coffee may help protect against type 2 diabetes.</h3><br>

            <p2>In 2014, researchers who gathered data on over 48,000 people found that those who increased their coffee
                consumption by at least one cup per day over 4 years had an 11% lower risk of type 2 diabetes than those
                who did not increase their intake.</p2><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p3>A meta-analysis from 2017 concluded that people who drank four to six cups of either caffeinated or
                decaffeinated coffee each day appeared to have a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, including type 2
                diabetes.</p3><br>

                thick canopies in the Western Ghats — a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the world’s most important
                biodiversity hotspots.</p4><br>

            <p5>In the 2016-17 season, India produced 5.5 million bags of coffee. A majority of the country’s coffee is
                grown in the three southern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, followed by Andhra Pradesh and
                Telangana, which was a part of Andhra Pradesh until recently.</p5><br>
